# Dynamic-SIR-Model-for-COVID-2019
Suffering the adverse impact of 2019 novel coronavirus, from
December,2019 to April,2020, governments restrained transport among cities, and
the opening of public places. Until April,3rd,2020, the quantity of cumulative
confirmed cases has exceeded 80 thousand cases, which causes continuous
impediment towards social production and development. This article aims at
establishing an epidemic model under modern containing system to describe the
development of the epidemic in Hubei Province. The development of 2019-nCoV in Hubei Province is divided into two phases
and analyze phase II delicately: Phase I, from December 31st,2019 to January 22rd,
2020, which is regarded as the free transmission phase of the epidemics; Phase II,
from January 23th, 2020 (the time when Hubei Province launched the policy to
lockdown cities)to April 3rd, which is considered to be the phase of isolation and
government’s containment.
For Phase I, considering public’s lacking awareness towards virus disease and
government’s shortage of effective containment. This phase can be regarded as
virus’s free transmission period, which can use Logistic model to describe.
For Phase II, considering 2019-nCoV’s infectivity and long incubation and
government’s complete and effective containments, this article modifies typical
SIR model and establish a dynamic SIR model which comprehends dynamic
parameters and the delay of confirming cases.
This article established the dynamic model for each phase, aiming to enhance
public’s comprehension towards epidemics and offer effective instruction for
epidemic prevention and containment.
